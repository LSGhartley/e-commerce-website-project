# Buhle's Handmadwe Patterns Website
This project is a database driven e-commerce website that I developed for my final year individual project using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. The website allows users to browse, search, and purchase products from different categories. It also features a user authentication system, a shopping cart, and a checkout process. The website uses MySQL as the database management system and Bootstrap as the front-end framework.

### Installation
To run this project, you need to have a web server that supports PHP and MySQL. You can use XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP for this purpose. Follow these steps to install the project:

Clone this repository to your web serverâ€™s root directory
Create a database named ecommerce and import the ecommerce.sql file from the database folder
Edit the config.php file in the includes folder and change the database credentials according to your configuration
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/ecommerce

### Usage
To use the website, you can either register as a new user or log in as an existing user. The default admin account is:

Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
You can browse the products by category or use the search bar to find a specific product. You can add products to your cart by clicking the Add to Cart button on the product page. You can view your cart by clicking the Cart icon on the top right corner of the website. You can proceed to checkout by clicking the Checkout button on the cart page. You will need to enter your shipping and payment details to complete the order.
